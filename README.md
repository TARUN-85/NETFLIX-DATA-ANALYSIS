# Streaming Platform Analysis

**Overview**
> This project involves the analysis of a streaming platform dataset using Python and its libraries, including NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. The aim is to extract actionable business insights and recommendations to increase profit. Additionally, the insights are visualized using Tableau for effective presentation and exploration.

**Tools Used**
> *Python Libraries:*
>> - NumPy
>> - Pandas
>> - Seaborn
>> - Matplotlib

> *Visualization Tool:*
>> - Tableau


### Analysis Process
> *Data Preparation and Exploration:* Cleaned the dataset using Pandas to handle missing values and ensure consistency.
Utilized NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation and exploration, calculating summary statistics and identifying patterns.


> *Analysis with Seaborn and Matplotlib:* Visualized various aspects of the streaming platform data, such as user engagement, content popularity, and subscription trends.
Explored correlations between variables to uncover insights into user behavior and preferences.


> *Business Insights and Recommendations:* Derived actionable insights to increase profitability, including:
>> - Identifying popular content genres to invest in.
>> - Optimizing content recommendations for user retention.
